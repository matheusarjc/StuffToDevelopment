<h1 align="center">React Libraries</h1>

I made a list with the most important (for me) libraries in React that i use in my projects.

## State Management

- [**Redux:**](https://redux.js.org) A predictable state container for JavaScript apps, offering a solid ecosystem with tools and extensions for efficient state management.
- [**MobX:**](https://mobx.js.org/README.html) Offers a simpler and more intuitive approach to state management with less boilerplate than Redux, suitable for those who prefer an object-oriented style.

## Routing

- [**React Router:**](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/overview) The standard library for handling navigation in React applications, enabling dynamic routing in single-page applications.

## UI Component Libraries

- [**Material-UI:**](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/) Provides a wide range of customizable components based on Google's Material Design.
- [**Ant Design:**](https://ant.design/components/overview/) A design system with high-quality React components for building rich, interactive UIs, inspired by Alibaba.
- [**Tailwind:**](https://tailwindcss.com/) A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building modern websites.

## Icons

- [**Lucide:**](https://lucide.dev/icons/)
- [**Phosphor Icons:**](https://phosphoricons.com)

## CSS in JS

-[**Styled-components:**](https://styled-components.com) Allows you to write actual CSS code to style your React components, promoting component-specific styling with a JavaScript-driven approach.

## Form Handling

-[**Formik:**](https://formik.org) Simplifies form handling in React, from maintaining form state to validation and submission.

- [**React Hook Form:**](https://react-hook-form.com) Focuses on performance and minimizing re-renders for complex forms by leveraging React hooks.

## Data Fetching and Caching

- [**React Query:**](https://www.sitepoint.com/react-query-fetch-manage-data/) A toolkit for fetching, caching, and updating asynchronous data in React, helping manage server-state without the boilerplate.
- [**SWR:**](https://swr.vercel.app/) SWR, meaning "Stale-while-revalidate" (old while revalidated), is another powerful library that focuses on simplicity and data reuse. Developed by Vercel, it uses a fetching strategy that first returns the data from the cache (Stale), then sends the fetch request (revalidate), and finally comes with the updated data. It’s great for creating fluid and fast user experiences.
- [**Redux Toolkit + RTK Query:**](https://redux-toolkit.js.org) If you are already using Redux in your project, Redux Toolkit’s RTK Query can be a valuable addition. RTK Query is part of the Redux Toolkit and provides an efficient way to perform data queries and caching with minimal configuration. It is designed to simplify data fetching, caching, and state updates, with excellent integration into the Redux ecosystem.

## Animation

- [**React Spring:**](https://react-spring.dev) A spring-physics based animation library ideal for creating fluid, natural motion effects in your React applications.

## Testing

- [**React Testing Library:**](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) Encourages good testing practices by allowing you to write tests that closely mimic how users interact with your application.

## Frameworks Built on React

- [**Next.js:**](https://nextjs.org) Not just a library but a React framework offering features like server-side rendering and static site generation, enhancing performance and SEO.
